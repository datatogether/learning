# Data Together Learning Materials

This primer introduces key concepts for community-based data stewardship and contains a series of tutorials explaining Data Together and showing how to add content to the network, annotate content thatâ€™s already on the network, and reinforce content that is already stored on the network.
As a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), it can be read in many different formats.

## First Steps

Check out the [Table of Contents](SUMMARY.md) or the sidebar on the left. Topics are broken down into _Tutorials_ with distinct _Lessons_ within each!

The [first tutorial](add-dataset/) covers adding a dataset to Data Together and reviews how Data Together is different from other forms of preserving data.

### Cloning this Repo

You can clone a copy of this repository using the following command line:

### Installing Dependencies

To install GitBook, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v4.0.0 or above) on your system and you must be running Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or Unix.

It is easiest to install `gitbook-cli` with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node.js package manager. From your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install gitbook-cli -g
```

Additional instructions for setting up and installing GitBook can be found in the [GitBook Toolchain Documentation](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html)

### Running Locally

Once you make changes to the contents, you can preview them by running a local GitBook server:

```bash
$ gitbook serve
```

After starting the server using the command above, visit `http://localhost:4000` (or whatever address was indicated by the `gitbook serve` command) in your web browser.

### Deploying

The [`scripts/`](scripts/) folder has all you need to rebuild the GitBook materials in multiple formats and publish to `gh-pages` and [datatogether.github.io/learning](https://datatogether.github.io/learning/):

```bash
$ bash scripts/build_formats.sh
$ bash scripts/publish_gh-pages.sh
```

You may need to install Calibre's ebook-convert cli tools. For Mac OS X, these can be copied from the Calibre application:

```bash
$ ln -s /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert /usr/local/bin
```
