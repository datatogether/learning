* Describe how Data Together helps groups steward data they care about

## Key Concepts

* Public Record
* Data Together Nodes
* Distributed Data Stewardship

## Lessons

### Add an Important Dataset{#lesson-one}

#### Step 1. Get information about a dataset

Before you start you'll want to know a little bit about the dataset you would like to archive on Data Together. At a minimum this should include the **name** and **web address** or [**URL** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) where the dataset can currently be accessed.

An example would be EPA's National Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory, currently located at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-greenhouse-gas-emission-inventory.
